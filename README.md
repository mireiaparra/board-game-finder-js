# Borad games finder (Javascript)
This is my Board games project built with Javascript, HTML & Sass. Here you'll find more about it and how to use it.

## Description

This project is a web page with a list of board games. You can filter them by name to find your favorite one. 

## How to use it
* **See the board games.** You'll be able to see a list of board games. They're returned from a third-party API. 
* **Filter by name.** There is the possibility to filter board games by name. You only need to write in the "Search" field, click the "Search" button and you'll see if there's any matching board game according to your search. 
* **Add favorites.** You can click a board game and it'll be automatically inserted in a favorites list. You'll see it only if there's at least one board game on it. Try to refresh the page. You'll yet be able to see your favorites ones!
* **Delete one.** You can always click on a favorite board game to delete it from the favorites list. You can also do it by clicking on the "X" button.
* **Delete all.** Did you have fun adding favorites board games, but now you are a bit tired about it? No problem, you can always click the "Delete all" button and the favorites list will be cleaned. 

## Technical instructions
You can **fork this repo** in your Pc and **open it** with your favorite code editor. It is made by the **Adalab template**, built with **node & gulp**. That's why you'll need to install **Nose JS** to work with it.
Then you'll need to **install the dependences** with `npm install` and run the project with `npm start`. That's all! Now you can open the `src/` folder and start programming.
